# Introduction
<p> Wellcome to EquiDonate - Verified Aid Application! </p>

<p>There are different NGOs working to help the needy people in the world. Some greedy people are taking the false benefit of their donations. For example some people take donations from NGOs even if they are not entitled to a donation. Some people have already received donations but they come to other NGOs for donations again. They are eating the right of those who are needy and have not got donations from any of the NGOs. </p>
<p>Our solution Verified Aid Application helps the NGOs to check the person who came to take the donation is eligible for donation based on parameters like monthly salary, no of family members etc. And any NGO from anywhere can check whether he has already received the donations already if yes how much (quantity), and which items he has received to know whether he is needy or not. </p>
